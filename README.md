# PENTA CANCER DETECTION SYSTEM USING DEEP LEARNING

In this project, we apply deep learning algorithms to classify the different types of cancer. 
We also apply the VGG16 architecture to predict the highest accuracy, which is an intelligent cancer recognition system that can automatically recognize the presence of cancer cells, combining the techniques of image processing and deep learning for determining five different types of cancer. 
Here, five different types of cancer such as lung cancer, skin cancer, cervical cancer, thyroid cancer and brain tumour are determined. 
Optimizing techniques like SGD - stochastic gradient descent, ADAM  and Activation methods like ReLU help to increase the accuracy. 
A web application will be developed where CT, MRI scans and histopathological images of organs will be given as input and the model will predict if it's cancerous or not.
